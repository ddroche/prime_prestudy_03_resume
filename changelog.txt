When I wrote this initially I tried to use HTML5 and CSS3 practices.  Looking through it quickly I see where there are ways in which I did that successfully, and things that need to be improved.  I will use this changelog file as a sort of "live-action blog" and update it as I change things.

1. Changed div with id="container" to a main tag, to semantically identify the main content of the page.  In this case, the whole resume is the main content.

2. The top portion of the page with the mugshot and personal info intro is acting like a header, thus I changed the div to a header tag.

3. The div used for the objective was changed to an article.

4. The wrapper div around the education, skills, and leadership boxes denotes a section of the page.  Div changed to section.  

5.  Changed the eduction, skills, and leadership divs to articles.

6. The divs that create the wrappers for the experience and involvement boxes were changed to sections.  Each is a larger box on the page that is filled with information through javascript...I'm realizing I'm going to have to be careful and think thoroughly through how I implemented the javascript to make it semantically correct.

7. I see that I have a div inside a div for the work experience area.  At first I couldn't remember why, and then I realized that it was for stylist purposes.  I struggled to get the look I wanted without doing the stacked divs like that.  I am not absolutely certain what the correct HTML5 should be semantically, but I believe it is to change the wrapper div to an article and leave the interior div alone.  I'm not sure if I can have a section inside another section or an article inside another article.  

8. The leadership area is structured different then the work experience area.  I made the sidebar div an aside, the inv div a section and each content area an article.

9. Added a <p> in the footer with copyright info.

10. At first glance in Chrome, it appears as though I broke the site.  I believe I just have to fix the CSS.

11. My suspicion was correct.  I style most things in this fashion: div#inv ...I had to change the div in the css rule to the appropriate tag that I replaced it with in the HTML.  Getting the initial tags switched in the CSS was simple enough.  However, It took me a while to find the lsat tag, and it was because of the rule I used.  I just didn't see it until after 20+ minutes of looking through my CSS to find it.

12. With that, I'm going to recommit this documnent.  I believe it to be updated.  I made the changes as necessary according to the lessons.
